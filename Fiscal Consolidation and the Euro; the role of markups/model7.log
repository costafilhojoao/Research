MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS:  The singularity seems to be (partly) caused by the presence of a unit root
MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS:  as the absolute value of one eigenvalue is in the range of +-1e-6 to 1.
MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS:  If the model is actually supposed to feature unit root behavior, such a warning is expected,
MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS:  but you should nevertheless check whether there is an additional singularity problem.
MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS:  The presence of a singularity problem typically indicates that there is one
MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS:  redundant equation entered in the model block, while another non-redundant equation
MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS:  is missing. The problem often derives from Walras Law.
Perfect foresight solution found.
