# Retrieving the state-space representation from Dynare

Jo√£o Costa-Filho

Latest version of the working paper version is available here.

## Abstract

How is it possible to recover the state-space representation after solving a DSGE model in Dynare? This note presents how to simulate impulse-response functions and the dynamics of a system after a series of exogenous shocks after solving the model with Dynare. I present two step-by-step framework applications, for a simple Real Business Cycles and the basic 3-equations New Keynesian model.

## Simulations

Make sure both the [RBC.mod](RBC.mod) file is in the working directory. 

The comment to solve the model, as well as the simulations (IRFs and after a series of technological shocks) are in the [simulations.m](simulations.m) file.
