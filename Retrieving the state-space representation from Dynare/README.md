# Retrieving the state-space representation from Dynare

Latest version of the working paper is available [here](https://www.joaocostafilho.com/research).

## Abstract

How is it possible to recover the state-space representation after solving a DSGE model in Dynare? This note presents how to simulate impulse-response functions and the
dynamics of a system after a series of exogenous shocks after solving the model with Dynare. I present a step-by-step framework and apply it to a simple Real Business Cycles model. Nevertheless, the same structure can be used in large DSGE models.

## Simulations

Make sure both the [RBC.mod](RBC.mod) file is in the working directory. 

Run [simulations.m](simulations.m) file for the examples in the paper.

I am still trying to figure out how to do it using [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/). If you have any thoughts on the matter, please contact me (I have started a Jupyter notebook entitled [RBC.ipynb](RBC.ipynb), but it needs to be corrected).
